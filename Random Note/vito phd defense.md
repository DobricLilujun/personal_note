# Today's random note



Potential Topic

1. The  application of **Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT)**** in solving inferential problems or planning problems focusing on insurance.

   Contract information extraction, insurance automated claim, fraud identification, risk management

   

2. The Graph of  Thought, A new framework increasing credibility and reduce random risks of reasoning problems

   Adding more possibility and accuracy to inference in several user cases, exploration the ability limit of LLMs

    

3. CoT optimization and problem solving in the direction of non-inferential  problem reasoning

   3.1 Text classification, token classification, translation, other ability in CV, audio and robotics

   3.2 Exploring  low cost and stable fine-tuning LLMs methods to text classification and   information extraction in the insurance industry

   

4. External  multi-modal data fusion using LLMs to establish an automated insurance claims framework 

   Images , audios ,videos etc. to give extra information to insurance claim (data fusion, multimodal LLMs)

   

5. Using  causal inference algorithms to enhance LLMsâ€™ inference capability and earn  subjective credibility (Causal AI inference enhancing LLMs inference ability )

   Add causal inference ability to LLMs by quantizing conditional probability between event etc.

   

6. Pure  causal inference in insurance risk management with multi-modal data

   Possible cooperation with [Elias Bareinboim](https://causalai.net/) from Colombia university in application of Finance, insurance and other application.
