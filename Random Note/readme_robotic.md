# readme_robotic

This is a robotic project for both path planning and task assignment in the warehouse.

## Demo global in Task assignment and A\* path planning**

To see a demo of the code, run the file demo.py. You can change the situation by editing example Situation. Further work have been given on A* algorithm in the correspond
ding folder.

If you use python and vscode, just generate the conda environment and select the corresponding python to run the code.

```cmd
Your_Path_to_Python robotics/robotics/demo.py
```



## Demo A\* Application in Java

To see the simulation results displayed in the poster in cube maze and 2D dimension, you need to run the code under a java environment.

There are two simulation folders in the Dynamic planning, one is called Manhattan distance which includes the all the cube maze simulation, another is called A_star_Algorithm_2D which includes all the two dimensional situation to simulate more complex situation of A* application.

To run the model, you need a JVM  (Java virtual machine ) to run the model which could be very easy and vscode can directly guide you to install one. One mistake users often make is that make sure your JVM is installed in your computer not your server or WSL (windows system for Linux). I made this mistake and it took me a lot of time to solve the problem.



In every folder, you can find a main entrance files  in which you can define the obstacles, size of the map and starting and destination points.



If you have any question, do not hesitate to ask me.
