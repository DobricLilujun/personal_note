SBM: Stochastic Block Model



Data set = A underlying adjacency matrix: 



Graphical model becomes



Zi    Zj   ->    xij





GNN:



Xi x2 x3 -> Data

Z1,z2,z3 -> unkonwn parameter without analytical expression



Mean field approximation:

EM -> VEM



Mean filed approximation instead of the :



Directed Graphical models:



Undirected Graphical models
